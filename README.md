# Distributed Weather Analysis and Anomaly Detection System

## Overview

The Distributed Weather Analysis and Anomaly Detection System is a comprehensive cloud-based solution that collects global weather data, processes it using distributed computing techniques, identifies weather anomalies, and provides predictive insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Features

- **Multi-source Weather Data Collection**: Gathers data from weather APIs across multiple global locations
- **Real-time Processing**: Streams and processes weather data as it arrives
- **Distributed Computing**: Uses Apache Beam for scalable data processing
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual weather patterns using statistical methods
- **Weather Enrichment**: Calculates additional weather metrics (heat index, wind chill, etc.)
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides a Streamlit-based dashboard for data exploration
- **Historical Analysis**: Tracks weather trends and pattern changes over time
- **Cloud-native Architecture**: Fully deployed on Google Cloud Platform
- **Real-time Alerting**: Notifies about detected weather anomalies

## System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Data Collection Module**: Python-based collector that pulls data from OpenWeatherMap API
2. **Cloud Storage**: GCS buckets for raw weather data
3. **Message Queue**: Pub/Sub for handling real-time data streams
4. **Processing Pipeline**: Apache Beam for distributed data processing
5. **Data Warehouse**: BigQuery for storing processed weather data
6. **Visualization Layer**: Streamlit dashboard for data analysis and visualization
7. **Anomaly Detection Service**: ML-powered service to identify unusual weather patterns
